<h1>What is FLAMES?</h1>
Flames is an acronym which stands out for <b>"Friends Lovers Admirers Marriage Enemies 'Secret Lovers'"</b>. This game can determine the relationship between two people with the use of their names. It is usually played among teens to find if they are compatible with their friends (crushes)😆 Well, I played some before and it was fun. Even though some websites use different meanings for the acronym, the words they use are just synonyms to the original, but the meaning above, is the original.
<h1>Is the FLAMES Game Real?</h1>
Simple answer, <b>No.</b> Other answer, well, it depends. The results you get after playing the game can actually go in your favour or it might not. Though it uses a simple algorithm, it can be real when it's results are true for you.

Technically speaking, the results produced are not real, it's just the results from a mathematical formula, so a <b>big noo!!</b>, It's not.
